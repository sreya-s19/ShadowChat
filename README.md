# ShadowChat ‚ö°


ShadowChat is a secure, real-time, text-only messaging application built with Python, Flask, and WebSockets. Designed with a focus on privacy and cybersecurity principles, it provides an intuitive chat experience while serving as an educational tool for concepts like end-to-end encryption and threat detection.

## ‚ú® Core Features

*   **‚ö° Real-Time Messaging:** Instant message delivery, typing indicators, and live online presence powered by **Flask-SocketIO**.
*   **üîê Secure Authentication:** Robust user registration and login system with strong password hashing (**bcrypt**) and secure session management.
*   **üîë Interactive Encryption Simulation:** Messages can be sent encrypted. The UI displays the ciphertext and allows users to manually decrypt it, making the concept of encryption tangible.
*   **üî¨ Cybercrime Keyword Alerts:** A built-in system flags messages containing suspicious keywords (e.g., "password", "hack") with a visual alert, simulating a threat detection system.
*   **üé® Modern & Polished UI:** A sleek, dark-themed, and responsive user interface inspired by modern chat applications.
*   **üîí Input Sanitization:** All message inputs are sanitized using `bleach` to prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.
